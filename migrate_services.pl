    # a waste since the aliases are normalized again when protocols are
    # combined while creating records. It's not clear you save any space by
    # storing aliases as a list (allowing multiple identical names to be stored
    # until being normalized away at the end) vs storing them as a hash
    # (storing useless hash values to keep the aliases normalized as keys.)
